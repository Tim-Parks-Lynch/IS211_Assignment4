Hi Professor,

For the sort_compare I had to lower the list count down to 10 lists, as the sorting algorithms with 100 loops and 5000 elements was killing my machine. The search_compare was fine though. I also created a main func and invoked it in the the `if __name__ == 'main'` portion of the code.

Questions:

The instructions say to return how long it takes each individual function to run. Why do we need to do this if we are already calculating the average inside of the main function? If so should I have calculated total_time differently?

I was also wondering if it might be more beneficial to only create 3 lists and sort them before the 2nd for loop?

Thanks,

Tim
