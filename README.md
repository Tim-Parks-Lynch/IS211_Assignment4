Hi Professor,

For the sort_compare I had to lower the list count down to 10 lists, as the sorting algorithms with 100 loops and 5000 elements was killing my machine. The search_compare was fine though. I also created a main func and invoked it in the the `if __name__ == 'main'` portion of the code. I was also wondering if it might be more beneficial to only create 3 lists and sort them before the 2nd for loop?

Thanks,

Tim
